## Nighthold Trinkets

I've updated the below list with the new Nighthold trinkets. You can view the theorycrafting backing their placement (or
omission) from the list here: [Nighthold Trinket Theorycrafting](/nighthold-trinkets)

**Summary:** None of the Nighthold trinkets are game-changing for us. High level stat sticks will still be better for
us.

(These priorities have been updated for the Jan 24 hotfix.)

For raids:  
[Perfectly Preserved Cake][cake] > [Etraeus' Celestial Map][map]> [Ephemeral Paradox][paradox] > [Aluriel's Mirror][mirror]

For dungeons: [Etraeus' Celestial Map][map] > [Perfectly Preserved Cake][cake]

## Trinket "Ranking"

Quoting Canibehealz from the resto discord:

> Some trinkets will see situationally better use than others. Cocoon makes a great early stat stick for a large amount of
> Int but should be replaced eventually. General use trinkets include Urn, Vial, Naglfar, Spine, Brinewater Crit/Mastery,
> Fluc. Energy esp. with Nightbane chest, Flask, WQ Crit/Mastery, Arcanocrystal, Chrono Shard. Its important to always
> make use of the procs/use effects of your trinkets and plan movement accordingly. Gathering Mana Orbs is easy enough. If
> your trinket procs and theres nothing to heal, try throwing out some faster Lightning Bolts. Senses can be a
> godsend or useless depending on when it procs. Consistency is better than anything else when it comes to healing, thats
> why so many static stat stick trinkets are on the list.  Flask will generally perform better than Senses, despite Senses
> slightly higher budget, just because of Static intellect. YMMV though

Rephrashing Canibehealz's quote, adding some sources, and adding Nighthold information:

- First, after the Jan 24 buffs, I *personally* consider [Perfectly Preserved Cake][cake] to be best-in-slot for the
  Nighthold fights currently (at a decent ilevel, anyway). There are some common misconceptions about how Cake works;
  here's how it goes:
    * The trinket is off GCD
    * The cake is placed instantly in front of you when you use it. It immediately affects yourself (maybe a bug)
      plus five other raid members within an 8 yard radius. No action or movement is required. If there are fewer
      than five other members, the cake persists for 20 seconds and will auto-apply to those who enter its radius
      (up to the cap).  See [this picture](/assets/cake-radius.jpg) to see where the trinket drops in relation to
      your character and how wide the radius of effect is. **Note:** The cake persists for a bit even after its
      charges are exhausted, so don't tell raid members to run to it if they see it, necessarily.
- Next, prefer stat sticks for their consistency. (That said, it may be hard to compete with the Nighthold trinkets,
  which have high base ilevel.) Examples of really good stat sticks:
    * [Unstable Arcanocrystal](http://www.wowhead.com/item=141482/) from Withered J'im world boss
    * [Ethereal Urn](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142166/) from Nightbane in Karazhan
    * [Brinewater Slime in a Bottle](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142507/brinewater-slime-in-a-bottle&bonus=605:1497)
      from Helya in ToV (raid) 
        + Any of the secondary stats is good, but we tend to prefer mastery (or crit)
- Next, prefer the "stat+proc" trinkets, like:
    * [Etraeus' Celestial Map][map] from Star Augur Etraeus in Nighthold
        + See the above Nighthold info. This is a little worse than a stat stick of the same item level, but it may
          be hard to find a stat stick at such a high ilevel currently.
    * [Ephemeral Paradox][paradox] from Elisande in Nighthold
        + May have a lower proc-per-minute value than the datamined value from Wowhead suggests (needs confirmation)
    * [Vial of Nightmare Fog][vial] from Dragons of Nightmare in Emerald Nightmare
    * [Amalgam's Seventh Spine](http://www.wowhead.com/item=136714/amalgams-seventh-spine&bonus=1532:1727) from
      Black Rook Hold
    * [Fluctuating Energy](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142162/fluctuating-energy) from Mana Worm in Karazhan
    * [Flask of the Solemn Night](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137484/flask-of-the-solemn-night&bonus=1532:1727) from
      Court of Stars
    * [Chrono Shard](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137419/chrono-shard&bonus=1532:1727) from Arcway
    * [Naglfar Fare](http://www.wowhead.com/item=133645/naglfar-fare&bonus=1532:1727) from Maw of Souls
        + [Vial of Nightmare Fog][vial], at the same ilevel, is *strictly better* than Naglfar Fare.
- Finally, some "starter trinkets":
    * [Darkmoon Deck: Promises](http://www.wowhead.com/item=128710/darkmoon-deck-promises&bonus=670:1482) (crafted)
    * [Darkmoon Deck: Hellfire](http://www.wowhead.com/item=128709/darkmoon-deck-hellfire&bonus=670:1482) (crafted)
    * [Cocoon of Enforced Solitude](http://www.wowhead.com/item=139322/cocoon-of-enforced-solitude&bonus=1805) from
      Elerethe Renferal in Emerald Nightmare
        + The on-use effect is 98% worthless. Prefer to use Leytorrent Potions instead. This is almost solely for
          static intellect. As a result, at the same ilevel, the Darkmoon trinkets above are better (same intellect,
          but with a better effect).
    * [Aluriel's Mirror][mirror]
        + Currently very underwhelming, especially for resto shaman

Special mention:

We get a lot of questions about [Heightened Senses][senses].  This trinket is usually not so great in raids because the
proc has approximately 25% uptime, and that 25% uptime may not align with high damage periods (that is, it could proc
when you have nothing to do but cast lightning bolt). Or, it might proc right when you need it, and it's great. So, in
raids, this is the gambler's trinket. That said, raid fights that require consistently strong healing are an exception
to the rule - like Cenarius. In those cases, Senses is good.

*However*, because of the way the real procs per minute (rppm) system works, this trinket is extremely strong in
dungeons. That's because the proc rate "fudge factor" resets when you exit and re-enter combat, which means the uptime
of Senses is very high in dungeons. 

**Note:** The [Etraeus' Celestial Map][map] trinket from Nighthold is in almost the exact same situation as Heightened
Senses. It's a proc-based trinket. However, the Map has intellect as its stat instead of Senses, so it's still alright
in raid, just not the best.
