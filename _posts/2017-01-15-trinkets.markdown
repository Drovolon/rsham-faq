This will be updated with Nighthold trinkets once I've got a better grasp on their relative value.

In other words (mostly, I am just rephrasing his quote and adding links/sources):

- Prefer stat sticks for their consistency. Examples of really good stat sticks:
    * [Unstable Arcanocrystal](http://www.wowhead.com/item=141482/) from Withered J'im world boss
    * [Ethereal Urn](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142166/) from Nightbane in Karazhan
    * [Brinewater Slime in a Bottle](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142507/brinewater-slime-in-a-bottle&bonus=605:1497)
      from Helya in ToV (raid) 
        + Any of the secondary stats is good, but we tend to prefer mastery (or crit)
- Next, prefer the "stat+proc" trinkets, like:
    * [Vial of Nightmare Fog](http://www.wowhead.com/item=138222/vial-of-nightmare-fog&bonus=1806) from Dragons of
      Nightmare in Emerald Nightmare
        + In a low-hps fight, the proc on Vial is worth intellect approximately equal to another trinket of its
          item level. In a high-hps fight, pure intellect is better (prefer a stat stick).
    * [Amalgam's Seventh Spine](http://www.wowhead.com/item=136714/amalgams-seventh-spine&bonus=1532:1727) from
      Black Rook Hold
    * [Fluctuating Energy](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142162/fluctuating-energy) from Mana Worm in Karazhan
    * [Flask of the Solemn Night](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137484/flask-of-the-solemn-night&bonus=1532:1727) from
      Court of Stars
    * [Chrono Shard](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137419/chrono-shard&bonus=1532:1727) from Arcway
    * [Naglfar Fare](http://www.wowhead.com/item=133645/naglfar-fare&bonus=1532:1727) from Maw of Souls
        + Vial of Nightmare Fog, at the same ilevel, is *strictly better* than Naglfar Fare.
- Finally, some "starter trinkets":
    * [Darkmoon Deck: Promises](http://www.wowhead.com/item=128710/darkmoon-deck-promises&bonus=670:1482) (crafted)
    * [Darkmoon Deck: Hellfire](http://www.wowhead.com/item=128709/darkmoon-deck-hellfire&bonus=670:1482) (crafted)
    * [Cocoon of Enforced Solitude](http://www.wowhead.com/item=139322/cocoon-of-enforced-solitude&bonus=1805) from
      Elerethe Renferal in Emerald Nightmare
        + The on-use effect is 98% worthless. Prefer to use Leytorrent Potions instead. This is almost solely for
          static intellect. As a result, at the same ilevel, the Darkmoon trinkets above are better (same intellect,
          but with a better effect).

These lists are not intended to imply an ranking or order.

Special mention:

We get a lot of questions about [Heightened Senses](http://www.wowhead.com/item=139330/heightened-senses&bonus=1806).
This trinket is usually not so great in raids because the proc has approximately 25% uptime, and that 25% uptime may not
align with high damage periods (that is, it could proc when you have nothing to do but cast lightning bolt). Or, it
might proc right when you need it, and it's great. So, in raids, this is the gambler's trinket. That said, raid fights
that require consistently strong healing are an exception to the rule - like Cenarius. In those cases, Senses is good.

*However*, because of the way the real procs per minute (rppm) system works, this trinket is extremely strong in
dungeons. That's because the proc rate "fudge factor" resets when you exit and re-enter combat, which means the uptime
of Senses is very high in dungeons.
