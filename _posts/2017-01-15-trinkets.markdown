## Trinket "Ranking"

- Stat sticks for their consistency. (That said, it may be hard to compete with the Nighthold trinkets,
  which have high base ilevel.) Examples of really good stat sticks:
    * [Unstable Arcanocrystal](http://www.wowhead.com/item=141482/) from Withered J'im world boss
    * [Ethereal Urn](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142166/) from Nightbane in Karazhan
    * [Brinewater Slime in a Bottle](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142507/brinewater-slime-in-a-bottle&bonus=605:1497)
      from Helya in ToV (raid) 
        + Any of the secondary stats is good, but we tend to prefer mastery (or crit)
- The value of [Perfectly Preserved Cake][cake] depends on your item level and the throughput requirements of the
  fight. Since the absorb doesn't scale with stats (except vers, which is irrelevant), for highly geared players
  with other trinket options, Cake won't be quite as good, especially since the legendary trinket is so powerful
  for us. Here's how it works:
    * The trinket is off GCD
    * The cake is placed instantly in front of you when you use it. It immediately affects yourself (maybe a bug)
      plus five other raid members within an 8 yard radius. No action or movement is required. If there are fewer
      than five other members, the cake persists for 20 seconds and will auto-apply to those who enter its radius
      (up to the cap). See [this picture](/assets/cake-radius.jpg) to see where the trinket drops in relation to
      your character and how wide the radius of effect is. **Note:** The cake persists for a bit even after its
      charges are exhausted, so don't tell raid members to run to it if they see it, necessarily.    
  Most folks around the 910+ item level range will be running stat sticks and/or [Etraeus' Celestial Map][map] 
  instead of Cake, along with the legendary trinket.
- Next, prefer the "stat+proc" trinkets, like
    * [Etraeus' Celestial Map][map] from Star Augur Etraeus in Nighthold
        + See the above Nighthold info. This is a little worse than a stat stick of the same item level, but it may
          be hard to find a stat stick at such a high ilevel currently.
    * [Ephemeral Paradox][paradox] from Elisande in Nighthold
        + If you don't think you can utilize the extra mana, then this isn't a good option.
    * [Vial of Nightmare Fog][vial] from Dragons of Nightmare in Emerald Nightmare
    * [Amalgam's Seventh Spine](http://www.wowhead.com/item=136714/amalgams-seventh-spine&bonus=1532:1727) from
      Black Rook Hold
    * [Fluctuating Energy](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142162/fluctuating-energy) from Mana Worm in Karazhan
    * [Flask of the Solemn Night](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137484/flask-of-the-solemn-night&bonus=1532:1727) from
      Court of Stars
    * [Chrono Shard](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137419/chrono-shard&bonus=1532:1727) from Arcway
    * [Naglfar Fare](http://www.wowhead.com/item=133645/naglfar-fare&bonus=1532:1727) from Maw of Souls
        + [Vial of Nightmare Fog][vial], at the same ilevel, is *strictly better* than Naglfar Fare.
- Finally, some "starter trinkets":
    * [Darkmoon Deck: Promises](http://www.wowhead.com/item=128710/darkmoon-deck-promises&bonus=670:1482) (crafted)
    * [Darkmoon Deck: Hellfire](http://www.wowhead.com/item=128709/darkmoon-deck-hellfire&bonus=670:1482) (crafted)
    * [Cocoon of Enforced Solitude](http://www.wowhead.com/item=139322/cocoon-of-enforced-solitude&bonus=1805) from
      Elerethe Renferal in Emerald Nightmare
        + The on-use effect is 98% worthless. Prefer to use Leytorrent Potions instead. This is almost solely for
          static intellect. As a result, at the same ilevel, the Darkmoon trinkets above are better (same intellect,
          but with a better effect).
    * [Aluriel's Mirror][mirror]
        + Currently very underwhelming, especially for resto shaman
