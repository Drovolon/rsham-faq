For a variety of reasons, the community does not provide stat weights or Pawn strings for resto shamans. Instead, we work on a priority system:

- Above 100% mastery
- Between 20% and 30% crit (personal preference)
- Between 5% and 15% haste (personal preference)
- Vers to taste

If you'd like concrete numbers, the midpoints are fine:

- Above 100% mastery
- About 25% crit
- About 10% haste

and will work well in both raid and dungeons.

In general, if a non-jewelry piece of gear has mastery and is 10 ilevels greater than your current piece, it's probably an upgrade.

Don't stress too much about "perfect" stats; so long as you're close to the above numbers, *you will be fine*.
Practicing and improving your own healing and play is way more useful than getting exactly 27.8% crit.

(Don't believe me? Go compare the stats of the Top 15 rsham healing parses on any fight.)
