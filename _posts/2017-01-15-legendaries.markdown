These rankings are subjective, but these are mostly in accord with the resto discord.

Excellent:

- [Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132444)
    * Fantastic for personal survival
- [Praetorian's Tidecallers](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137058)
    * Strong synergy with Nighthold 4-piece. Interaction with [Healing Stream Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5394) was fixed in Patch 7.1.5.

Very good:

- [Focuser of Jonat, the Elder](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137051)
- [Velen's Future Sight](http://www.wowhead.com/item=144258) (this might be "excellent" - need more logs/conversation to be sure)

Situationally Good:

- [Uncertain Reminder](http://www.wowhead.com/item=143732)
    * May be excellent for some fights, in particular those where Bloodlust is used during high damage periods (e.g. Cenarius).
      [Sense of Urgency](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207355/sense-of-urgency) *does* persist into the bonus bloodlust
      period, as confirmed in logs.
- [Sephuz's Secret](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132452)
    * May be good for fights that have frequent dispels/interrupts and also have opportunities to put that haste to use

OK:

- [Nobundo's Redemption](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137104)
- [Elemental Rebalancers](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137036)
- [Roots of Shaladrassil](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132466)

Meh:

- [Intact Nazjatar Molting](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137085)
