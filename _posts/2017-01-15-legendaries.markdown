These rankings are subjective. [Contact me](/about) if you disagree.

Survival:

These legendaries don't directly affect throughput (besides their stats) except insofar as they help you survive. That is really valuable. For example,
I choose to run Roots 

- [Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132444)
    * Fantastic for personal survival - the shield is very strong - and has an absurd amount of stats.
- [Roots of Shaladrassil](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132466)
    * Good, steady self-healing on top of amazing stats. Feeds into [Cloudburst Totem][cbt] and is affected 
      by [Ancestral Guidance][ag], for what it's worth (but this is just a bonus).

Excellent:

- [Velen's Future Sight](http://www.wowhead.com/item=144258)
	* Combos with our various healing CDs thanks to its low CD; the overheal redistribution is very effective for CDs like Ascendance and 
	  Healing Tide totem. 
- [Praetorian's Tidecallers](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137058)
    * Has synergy with Nighthold 4-piece. Extra duration on SLT and HTT are both very nice, if you can effectively utilize them.
- [Focuser of Jonat, the Elder](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137051)

Situationally Good:

- [Nobundo's Redemption](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137104)
	* If the fight has opportunity for frequent chain heals needing frequent spot heals, this will work very well.
	  Works well for Mythic Gul'dan, for example.
- [Uncertain Reminder](http://www.wowhead.com/item=143732)
    * May be excellent for some fights, in particular those where Bloodlust is used during high damage periods (e.g. Cenarius).
      [Sense of Urgency](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207355/sense-of-urgency) *does* persist into the bonus bloodlust
      period.
- [Sephuz's Secret](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132452)
    * May be good for fights that have frequent dispels/interrupts and also have opportunities to put that haste to use.

Meh:

- [Elemental Rebalancers](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137036)
   * Low item budget. The HPS gain doesn't apply to healing rain itself (and in ToS, our HR will be strong). May be good in fights
     where everyone is always stacked and you can effectively guarantee its use, but otherwise: hard pass.
- [Intact Nazjatar Molting](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137085)
	* Bad stats, and if the raid is low enough that spamming Riptide is attractive, then Chain Heal will be more attractive.
	  On top of that, such situations usually have raid CDs planned. Probably our worst legendary.
