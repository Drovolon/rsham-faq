These rankings are subjective. [Contact me](/about) if you disagree.

Survival:

These legendaries don't directly affect throughput (besides their stats) except insofar as they help you survive. That is really valuable. For example,
I choose to run Prydaz instead of Nobundo because I value the extra durability more than the throughput increase from Nobundo. Whether you should do
the same is very subjective, but don't underestimate the value of survival.

- [Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132444)
    * Fantastic for personal survival - the shield is very strong - and has an absurd amount of stats.
- [Roots of Shaladrassil](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132466)
    * Good, steady self-healing. Feeds into [Cloudburst Totem][cbt] and is affected by [Ancestral Guidance][ag], for what it's worth. 

Excellent:

- [Praetorian's Tidecallers](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137058)
    * Strong synergy with Nighthold 4-piece. Interaction with [Healing Stream Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5394) was fixed in Patch 7.1.5.
- [Focuser of Jonat, the Elder](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137051)

Good:

- [Velen's Future Sight](http://www.wowhead.com/item=144258)
    * Need more logs and community discussion to pin down the value of this legendary, but *my* initial impression is that it's good

Situationally Good:

- [Uncertain Reminder](http://www.wowhead.com/item=143732)
    * May be excellent for some fights, in particular those where Bloodlust is used during high damage periods (e.g. Cenarius).
      [Sense of Urgency](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207355/sense-of-urgency) *does* persist into the bonus bloodlust
      period, as confirmed in logs.
- [Sephuz's Secret](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132452)
    * May be good for fights that have frequent dispels/interrupts and also have opportunities to put that haste to use

OK:

- [Nobundo's Redemption](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137104)
- [Elemental Rebalancers](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137036)
   * May be more valuable in Nighthold since there are a lot of fights where Healing Rain is great

Meh:

- [Intact Nazjatar Molting](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137085)
