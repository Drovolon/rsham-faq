This guide is written for newer restoration shamans who are interested in healing dungeons. This guide does not claim to
present the "best" or "only" way to heal dungeons as an rsham: instead, it presents a method of dungeon healing that has
worked for many folks so far.

First of all, take this talent build:

![Dungeon talent build](/assets/dungeon-talents.png)

Feel free to swap Graceful Spirit for Gust of Wind. Other adjustments can be made based on your preferences,
but this build is an excellent starting point for dungeon healing.

When healing dungeons, take opportunities between pulls to drink for mana. In other words: except for
Tyrannical boss fights that last a while, mana should not be a concern in dungeons. If needed, use mana potions: 
ancient mana potions are cheap.

## Rotation

As a general "healing rotation" for dealing with incoming damage, use

[Riptide][riptide] &rarr; [Healing Surge][surge] &rarr; [Healing Surge][surge] &rarr; [Riptide][riptide] ... repeat

Because of [Crashing Waves](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197464/crashing-waves), each riptide grants two stacks
of [Tidal Waves](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=53390/tidal-waves). That makes your next healing surge have a very
high chance to crit, which in turn will give [Queen Ascendant](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207285/queen-ascendant)
very high uptime. In other words, you'll be bonking party members with healing surge crits (which are on the order
of about 500k), with every 3rd healing surge being buffed by the [Undulation](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200071/undulation)
talent (which will be on the order of 750k), and because of QA, you will enjoy very high haste in this rotation. 

Those 500k/750k numbers are not taking our mastery into account. On a low health target, an undulation'd surge can
easily heal for over 1 million health. You can frequently take nearly-dead DPS straight to full health this way.

These healing surges will eat your mana, but as mentioned above, drink between pulls.

In cases where party members all need moderate healing, use [Chain Heal][ch] or (better, if available)
the [Gift of the Queen][gotq] artifact ability. Surge is not your only tool; it's merely the best for the 
strong single-target healing required in dungeons.

Frequently drop [Healing Stream Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5394/healing-stream-totem) where applicable. It does
an appreciable amount of "passive" healing and is great for taking care of the people who need light healing. That lets
you spend more time on DPS.

## Cooldowns

With this build, you have three healing cooldowns at your disposal:

- [Ascendance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052)

Use Ascendance for periods of high group-wide damage. It has a 15 second duration and 3 minute cooldown, so you can use
it several times in a dungeon. With Ascendance going, your Healing Surges will be duplicated and split to all the party
members *within 20 yards*. This will effectively make your group immortal, so long as the damage is actually healable.

- [Healing Tide Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280)

Use HTT for periods of moderate, sustained damage - for example, for the Latern of Darkness in Maw of Souls.
HTT will help you keep up with incoming damage, but it won't single-handedly save the group.

- [Spirit Link Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008)

SLT is probably the most _interesting_ ability in our toolkit. It creates one giant "health pool" out of
everyone who stands in it.

SLT is the preferred cooldown for cases where there are extreme differences in group members' health. For example,
it can be used to save a tank who is nearly dead (so long as you and the DPS have sufficient healh to redistribute).
It can also be used to save pulls where the tank has not established aggro appropriately on the mobs, and as a result
they are walking around hitting random people - for example, the jump off point in Vault where you may aggro several
spirits and spiders. In those cases, total damage taken by the group is still higher than usual (because a mage has
far less mitigation than a warrior tank, for example), but as long as everyone's inside the link, you can usually
heal through it.

## General Responsibilities

Help with DPS. Use [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188389/flame-shock) and
[Lava Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst) when minor heals are required (especially if Healing Stream
Totem is out). Our mastery makes our heals more effective on lower health targets, so don't feel rushed to heal someone
who is at 95% health (unless there is impending doom). In heroic/mythic/low level M+, as a healer, you can do very
respectable damage on trash pulls.

Use [Lightning Surge Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058) to help with stuns on trash pulls. 
Coordinated group stuns are extremely potent in dungeons, and surge totem (also sometimes called "cap totem"
or "capacitor totem," its previous name) is no exception. You should try to use cap totem almost on cooldown,
usually every other trash pack. Try not to overlap it with another AOE stun. 

Cap totem basically stops the damage the group is taking for 5 seconds, in almost all cases. If you know
a pull's going to be bad, use it when you feel you can't keep up with the incoming damage anymore.

Use [Wind Shear](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=57994) to help with interrupts. Proper interrupts are also
extremely potent in dungeons, and at higher M+ levels they are effectively required in some dungeons
(e.g., Arcway). Wind Shear is the best interrupt in the game: 30 yard range, 12 second cooldown. 

I usually let the tank take the 1st interrupt (most do) and then I take the 2nd. If there's a competent
melee DPS in your group, they may take the 2nd interrupt instead; at that point you probably aren't
in an interrupt rotation. *Be prepared to interrupt anyway.* People are flaky, so expect them to miss
interrupts, and don't be flaky yourself.
