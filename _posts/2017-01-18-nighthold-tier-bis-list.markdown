**Should we get the 2-piece bonus?** Yes. In raid, you can expect 3-5% extra healing on most fights, and maybe even
higher depending on your playstyle. Also, the 2-piece is a *significant* buff in dungeons, since [Healing Surge][surge]
is your primary heal (see [Dungeon Healing Guide](/dungeon-healing)).

**Should we get the 4-piece bonus?** Yes. In raid, you can expect between 5% and 10% extra healing on most fights,
depending on the HPS requirements, your playstyle, and whether or not you have [Praetorian's
Tidecallers](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137058). It is significant.

**Does the 4-piece proc when you generate a Tidal Waves charge or when you spend one?** It procs when you generate
one. That's why it's so powerful. Frequent chain heals are still potent with the 4-piece. (Note: it only procs &minus;3 
seconds when you [Riptide][riptide] with [Crashing Waves](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197464/crashing-waves) - it
*doesn't* count the two charges as &minus;6 sec.)

**Which pieces should we get?** Llenne has curated a [community BiS guide for
Nighthold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JDs9yaU-xFctoalGoQSX_JkvGOCx6qTC3deG9BRj4VM/) that gives some
starting points.

**Is it worth dropping Drape of Shame for the tier cloak?** Probably, if you can get a higher item level one. As one of the
tier pieces with high mastery, the tier cloak is valuable.

**I don't like those stats. Should I take the 4-piece?** Yes.
