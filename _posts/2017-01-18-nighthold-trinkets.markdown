Here's some theorycrafting about Nighthold trinkets:

- [Ephemeral Paradox][paradox] from Elisande. Only affects Healing Wave (that is, it procs off all heals, but only makes
  Healing Wave free/restore mana). According to Wowhead, this trinket has a proc rate set at &asymp;1.2 procs per
  minute. This gives a mana return of:
  
      1.2 * (3869 + 19800) = 28402 mana
  
  per minute. Over a 5-minute fight, that's 142k mana restored - about 2.5 chain heal casts - which you could use to heal
  3 million or so health. Maybe a 2-4% bump in overall healing.

- [Etraeus' Celestial Map][map] from Star Augur Etraeus.  According to Wowhead, this trinket has approximately 2 procs
  per minute, leading to (2 &times; 8 sec / 60 sec) &asymp; 27% uptime. As a relatively low uptime proc trinket, the Map
  won't be all that great in raid, other than the fact that it has intellect as its stat (and since it's Nighthold gear,
  it will drop at a high item level). See the bottom of the [Trinkets](/trinkets) post about this trinket and
  [Heightened Senses][senses], which are very similar.

- [Perfectly Preserved Cake][cake] from Trilliax. This trinket is... interesting. A useful Wowhead comment tells us it
  has these properties:
    * The cake is placed instantly in front of you when you use it; there's no targeting
    * The trinket is off GCD
    * Allies just need to walk near the cake (about a 10 yard radius) to get the benefit from the cake - no interaction
      required - but there is a 5 ally limit

  So, this trinket (at 900 item level) places five 296k absorbs (= 1.48 mil total) every 2 minutes, or about 740k
  absorbs per minute on average. Not bad - [Vial of Nightmare Fog][vial], for example, does about the same absorbs per
  minute at similar ilevels.  Plus, with mastery as its stat, it fits our stat priority really well. **I think this
  trinket is probably better than [Vial of Nightmare Fog][vial] for similar item levels,** if used properly (which should not be
  that hard, given the information above). This is especially the case for Nighthold, which has several fights where the
  raid stacks.

- [Aluriel's Mirror][mirror] from Spellblade Aluriel. According to Wowhead, this trinket has approximately 3 procs per
  minute, giving a total healing of 321k healing per minute (in the form of a 12 sec HoT) plus the *chance* for some 58k
  AoE explosions. (Note: this is assuming 905 item level.) As far as heals per minute goes, this seems weak for a
  trinket, and combined with the haste stat, I think **this is the weakest trinket in Nighthold for us.** (Also, I
  suspect this trinket will have a high percentage of overhealing.)
