This site was built by (Discord handle) Drovolon#8860 during Nighthold in Legion. At the time, it was intended to
provide highly opinionated, straight-to-the-point answers to frequently asked questions in the Earthshrine
\#restoration channel. It was aimed at newer restoration shamans who were looking for basic information.

Since then, an enterprising group of folks has put together a far more comprehensive site, [Ancestral Guidance][ag],
that contains all the same information this site gave and much more, not to mention being up to date. For that
reason, the old individual posts now redirect to the latest matching AG articles (well, at least at the time of
writing).

This site's code and deployment scripts live [on GitHub][github]. Pull requests are accepted, if for some reason
something actually needs to change.
