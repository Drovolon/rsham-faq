This site is intended to provide *opinionated* answers to frequently asked questions in the Earthshrine #restoration
channel. It's aimed primarily at newer restoration shamans who are looking for information about stat priorities,
legendary priorities, dungeon talent builds, trinket information, and so on.

This site is maintained by (Discord handle) Drovolon#8860, who idles in the Earthshrine #restoration channel, if you'd
like to talk. Feel free to message me directly on Discord about this guide, but please direct general advice questions
to the #restoration channel. I am not infallible and it's best that folks in #restoration are around to double-check any
answers I give.

You can also contribute [on GitHub](https://github.com/Drovolon/rsham-faq). Pull requests accepted.
